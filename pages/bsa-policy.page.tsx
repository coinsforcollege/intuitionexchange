          1. Intuition Exchange Policy
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          It is the policy of the Intuition Exchange to prohibit and actively
          prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money
          laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal activities by
          complying with all applicable requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act
          (BSA) and its implementing regulations.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to
          conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so
          that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or
          constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in
          three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the
          &quot;placement&quot; stage, where the cash generated from criminal
          activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money
          orders or traveler&apos;s checks, or deposited into accounts at
          financial institutions. At the &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds
          are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial
          institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin.
          At the &quot;integration&quot; stage, the funds are reintroduced into
          the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other
          criminal activities or legitimate businesses.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Although cash is rarely deposited into securities accounts, the
          securities industry is unique in that it can be used to launder funds
          obtained elsewhere, and to generate illicit funds within the industry
          itself through fraudulent activities. Examples of types of fraudulent
          activities include insider trading, market manipulation, ponzi
          schemes, cybercrime and other investment-related fraudulent activity.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct,
          but rather an attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or
          their intended use, which could be for criminal purposes. Legitimate
          sources of funds are a key difference between terrorist financiers and
          traditional criminal organizations. In addition to charitable
          donations, legitimate sources include foreign government sponsors,
          business ownership and personal employment. Although the motivation
          differs between traditional money launderers and terrorist financiers,
          the actual methods used to fund terrorist operations can be the same
          as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder funds.
          Funding for terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of
          money and the associated transactions may not be complex.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to
          ensure compliance with all applicable BSA regulations and FINRA rules
          and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure
          appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls are in place to
          account for both changes in regulations and changes in our business.

          2. AML Compliance Person Designation and Duties
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          The Intuition Exchange has designated Joshua Samuel as its Anti-Money
          Laundering Program Compliance Person (AML Compliance Person), with
          full responsibility for the Intuition Exchange&rsquo;s AML program. He
          has a working knowledge of the BSA and its implementing regulations
          and is qualified by experience, knowledge, and training. The duties of
          the AML Compliance Person will include monitoring the Intuition
          Exchange&rsquo;s compliance with AML obligations, overseeing
          communication and training for employees. The AML Compliance Person
          will also ensure that the Intuition Exchange keeps and maintains all
          the required AML records and will ensure that Suspicious Activity
          Reports (SARs) are filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
          (FinCEN) when appropriate. The AML Compliance Person is vested with
          full responsibility and authority to enforce the Intuition
          Exchange&rsquo;s AML program.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          The Intuition Exchange will provide FINRA with contact information for
          the AML Compliance Person through the FINRA Contact System (FCS),
          including: (1) name; (2) title; (3) mailing address; (4) email
          address; (5) telephone number; and (6) facsimile (if any). The
          Intuition Exchange will promptly notify FINRA of any change in this
          information through FCS and will review, and if necessary, update,
          this information within 17 business days after the end of each
          calendar year. The annual review of FCS information will be conducted
          by AML Compliance Person and will be completed with all necessary
          updates being provided no later than 17 business days following the
          end of each calendar year. In addition, if there is any change to the
          information, AML Compliance Person will update the information
          promptly, but in any event not later than 30 days following the
          change.&nbsp;

          A. FinCEN Requests Under USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(a)
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will respond to a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
          request concerning accounts and transactions (a 314(a) Request) by
          immediately searching our records to determine whether we maintain or
          have maintained any account for, or have engaged in any transaction
          with, individual, entity or organization named in the 314(a) Request
          as outlined in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) located on
          FinCEN&rsquo;s secure website. We understand that we have 14 days
          (unless otherwise specified by FinCEN) from the transmission date of
          the request to respond to a 314(a) Request. We will designate through
          the FINRA Contact System (FCS) one or more persons to be the point of
          contact (POC) for 314(a) Requests and will promptly update the POC
          information following any change in such information. (
          <em>See also</em> Section 2 above regarding updating of contact
          information for the AML Compliance Person.) Unless otherwise stated in
          the 314(a) Request or specified by FinCEN, we are required to search
          those documents outlined in FinCEN&rsquo;s FAQ. If we find a match,
          AML Compliance Person will report it to FinCEN via FinCEN&rsquo;s
          Web-based 314(a) Secure Information Sharing System within 14 days or
          within the time requested by FinCEN in the request. If the search
          parameters differ from those mentioned above (for example, if FinCEN
          limits the search to a geographic location), AML Compliance Person
          will structure our search accordingly.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          If AML Compliance Person searches our records and does not find a
          matching account or transaction, then he will not reply to the 314(a)
          Request. We will maintain documentation that we have performed the
          required search by [Example:{" "}
          <em>printing a search self-verification document from FinCEN</em>
          <em>&rsquo;</em>

            number of accounts searched, the name of the individual conducting
            the search and a notation of whether or not a match was found
          </em>
          .

        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will not disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested or obtained
          information from us, except to the extent necessary to comply with the
          information request. AML Compliance Person will review, maintain, and
          implement procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of
          requests from FinCEN similar to those procedures established to
          satisfy the requirements of Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
          with regard to the protection of customers&rsquo; non-public
          information.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will direct any questions we have about the 314(a) Request to the
          requesting federal law enforcement agency as designated in the
          request.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) Request, we will not be required
          to treat the information request as continuing in nature, and we will
          not be required to treat the periodic 314(a) Requests as a government
          provided list of suspected terrorists for purposes of the customer
          identification and verification requirements.&nbsp;

          B. National Security Letters
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We understand that the receipt of a National Security Letter (NSL) is
          highly confidential. We understand that none of our officers,
          employees or agents may directly or indirectly disclose to any person
          that the FBI or other federal government authority has sought or
          obtained access to any of our records. To maintain the confidentiality
          of any NSL we receive, we will process and maintain the NSL
          internally. If we file a SAR after receiving an NSL, the SAR will not
          contain any reference to the receipt or existence of the NSL. The SAR
          will only contain detailed information about the facts and
          circumstances of the detected suspicious activity.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Title level={5}>C. Grand Jury Subpoenas</Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We understand that the receipt of a grand jury subpoena concerning a
          customer does not in itself require that we file a Suspicious Activity
          Report (SAR). When we receive a grand jury subpoena, we will conduct a
          risk assessment of the customer subject to the subpoena as well as
          review the customer&rsquo;s account activity. If we uncover suspicious
          activity during our risk assessment and review, we will elevate that
          customer&rsquo;s risk assessment and file a SAR in accordance with the
          SAR filing requirements. We understand that none of our officers,
          employees or agents may directly or indirectly disclose to the person
          who is the subject of the subpoena its existence, its contents, or the
          information we used to respond to it. To maintain the confidentiality
          of any grand jury subpoena we receive, we will process and maintain
          the subpoena by internally. If we file a SAR after receiving a grand
          jury subpoena, the SAR will not contain any reference to the receipt
          or existence of the subpoena. The SAR will only contain detailed
          information about the facts and circumstances of the detected
          suspicious activity.

          D. Voluntary Information Sharing With Other Financial Institutions
          Under USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(b)
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will share information with other financial institutions regarding
          individuals, entities, organizations and countries for purposes of
          identifying and, where appropriate, reporting activities that we
          suspect may involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering.
          AML Compliance Person will ensure that the Intuition Exchange files
          with FinCEN an initial notice before any sharing occurs and annual
          notices thereafter. We will use the notice form found at{" "}
          <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN&rsquo;s website</a>
          <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/">.</a> Before we share information
          with another financial institution, we will take reasonable steps to
          verify that the other financial institution has submitted the
          requisite notice to FinCEN, either by obtaining confirmation from the
          financial institution or by consulting a list of such financial
          institutions that FinCEN will make available. We understand that this
          requirement applies even to financial institutions
          <em> with which we are affiliated</em>, and that we will obtain the
          requisite notices from affiliates and follow all required procedures
          <em>.</em>
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will employ strict procedures both to ensure that only relevant
          information is shared and to protect the security and confidentiality
          of this information, for example, by segregating it from the Intuition
          Exchange&rsquo;s other books and records.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We also will employ procedures to ensure that any information received
          from another financial institution shall not be used for any purpose
          other than:
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <ul>

          E. Joint Filing of SARs by Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
          Institutions
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          <em>
            The obligation to identify and properly report a suspicious
            transaction and to timely file a SAR rests separately with each
            broker-dealer. However, one SAR may be filed for a suspicious
            activity by all broker-dealers involved in a transaction (so long as
            the report filed contains all relevant and required information) if
            the SAR is jointly filed. In addition, if a broker-dealer and
            another financial institution that is subject to the SAR regulations
            are involved in the same suspicious transaction, the financial
            institution may also file a SAR jointly (so long as the report filed
            contains all relevant and required information). For example, a
            broker-dealer and an insurance company may file one SAR with respect
            to suspicious activity involving the sale of variable insurance
            products. Disclosures that are made for the purposes of jointly
            filing a SAR are protected by the safe harbor contained in the SAR
            regulations. The financial institutions that jointly file a SAR
            shall each be separately responsible for maintaining a copy of the
            SAR and should maintain their own SAR supporting documentation in
            accordance with BSA recordkeeping requirements. See generally

          We will file joint SARs in the following circumstances, according to [
          <em>describe procedures</em>]. We will also share information about a

        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          <em>
            Although not part of the BSA and its implementing regulations, the
            Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance is often
            performed in conjunction with AML compliance. OFAC is an office of
            the U.S. Treasury that administers and enforces economic sanctions
            and embargoes based on U.S. foreign policy and national security
            goals that target geographic regions and governments (e.g., Cuba,
            Sudan and Syria), as well as individuals or entities that could be
            anywhere (e.g., international narcotics traffickers, foreign
            terrorists and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction). As
            part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of Specially
            Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN list), which includes
            names of companies and individuals who are connected with the
            sanctions targets. U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with
            SDNs wherever they are located, and all SDN assets must be blocked.
            Because OFAC&apos;s programs are constantly changing, describe how
            you will check with OFAC to ensure that your SDN list is current and
            also that you have complete information regarding the listings of
            economic sanctions and embargoes enforced by OFAC affecting
            countries and parties before opening an account and for existing
            accounts.

          information described above when requested, or appears to have

          not open a new account and, after considering the risks involved,

        <Typography.Title level={5}>C. Verifying Information</Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we
          will ensure that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true
          identity of our customers by using risk-based procedures to verify and
          document the accuracy of the information we get about our customers.
          AML Compliance Person will analyse the information we obtain to
          determine whether the information is sufficient to form a reasonable
          belief that we know the true identity of the customer (<em>e.g.</em>,
          whether the information is logical or contains inconsistencies).
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will verify customer identity through &lsquo;Secure SDK&rsquo;, a
          third-party KYC verification service provider. We will use documents
          to verify customer identity when appropriate documents are available.
          In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will
          supplement the use of documentary evidence by using the
          non-documentary means described below whenever necessary. We may also
          use nondocumentary means, if we are still uncertain about whether we
          know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the information,
          we will consider whether the identifying information that we receive,
          such as the customer&rsquo;s name, street address, zip code, telephone
          number (if provided), date of birth and Social Security number, allow
          us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true
          identity of the customer (<em>e.g.</em>, whether the information is
          logical or contains inconsistencies).&nbsp;
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Appropriate documents for verifying the identity of customers include
          the following:&nbsp;
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification
            evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or
            similar safeguard, such as a driver&rsquo;s license or passport; and
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a person other than an individual, documents showing the
            existence of the entity, such as certified articles of
            incorporation, a government-issued business license, a partnership
            agreement or a trust instrument.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We understand that we are not required to take steps to determine
          whether the document that the customer has provided to us for identity
          verification has been validly issued and that we may rely on a
          government-issued identification as verification of a customer&rsquo;s
          identity. If, however, we note that the document shows some obvious
          form of fraud, we must consider that factor in determining whether we
          can form a reasonable belief that we know the customer&rsquo;s true
          identity.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will use the following non-documentary methods of verifying
          identity:
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Independently verifying the customer&rsquo;s identity through the
            comparison of information provided by the customer with information
            obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database or other
            source <em>[identify reporting agency, database, etc.]</em>;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking references with other financial institutions; or</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Obtaining a financial statement.</li>
        </ul>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will use non-documentary methods of verification when:&nbsp;
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued
            identification document with a photograph or other similar
            safeguard;
          </li>
          <li>
            the Intuition Exchange is unfamiliar with the documents the customer
            presents for identification verification;
          </li>
          <li>
            the customer and Intuition Exchange do not have face-to-face
            contact; and
          </li>
          <li>
            there are other circumstances that increase the risk that the
            Intuition Exchange will be unable to verify the true identity of the
            customer through documentary means.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will verify the information within a reasonable time before or
          after the account is opened. Depending on the nature of the account
          and requested transactions, we may refuse to complete a transaction
          before we have verified the information, or in some instances when we
          need more time, we may, pending verification, restrict the types of
          transactions or dollar amount of transactions. If we find suspicious
          information that indicates possible money laundering, terrorist
          financing activity, or other suspicious activity, we will, after
          internal consultation with the Intuition Exchange&apos;s AML
          Compliance Person, file a SAR in accordance with applicable laws and
          regulations.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We recognize that the risk that we may not know the customer&rsquo;s
          true identity may be heightened for certain types of accounts, such as
          an account opened in the name of a corporation, partnership or trust
          that is created or conducts substantial business in a jurisdiction
          that has been designated by the U.S. as a primary money laundering
          jurisdiction, a terrorist concern, or has been designated as a
          non-cooperative country or territory. We will identify customers that
          pose a heightened risk of not being properly identified. We will also
          take the following additional measures that may be used to obtain
          information about the identity of the individuals associated with the
          customer when standard documentary methods prove to be insufficient.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Title level={5}>D. Lack of Verification</Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          When we cannot form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity
          of a customer, we will do the following: (1) not open an account; (2)
          impose terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while we
          attempt to verify the customer&rsquo;s identity; (3) close an account
          after attempts to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity fail; and (4)
          determine whether it is necessary to file a SAR in accordance with
          applicable laws and regulations.

          We will document our verification, including all identifying
          information provided by a customer, the methods used and results of
          verification, and the resolution of any discrepancies identified in
          the verification process. We will keep records containing a
          description of any document that we relied on to verify a
          customer&rsquo;s identity, noting the type of document, any
          identification number contained in the document, the place of
          issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date. With
          respect to non-documentary verification, we will retain documents that
          describe the methods and the results of any measures we took to verify
          the identity of a customer. We will also keep records containing a
          description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy
          discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. We
          will retain records of all identification information for five years
          after the account has been closed; we will retain records made about
          verification of the customer&apos;s identity for five years after the

            the transaction involves funds derived from illegal activity or is

            the transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not

          attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering
          schemes. In addition, although we are not required to, we may contact
          that SEC in cases where a SAR we have filed may require immediate
          attention by the SEC. <em>See</em> Section 11 for contact numbers. We
          also understand that, even if we notify a regulator of a violation,
          unless it is specifically covered by one of the exceptions in the SAR
          rule, we must file a SAR reporting the violation.

          We may file a voluntary SAR for any suspicious transaction that we
          believe is relevant to the possible violation of any law or regulation

          is our policy that all SARs will be reported regularly to the Board of

          BSA regulations. We will file a SAR-SF no later than 30 calendar days
          after the date of the initial detection of the facts that constitute a
          basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect is identified on the date of
          initial detection, we may delay filing the SAR for an additional 30
          calendar days pending identification of a suspect, but in no case will
          the reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of
          initial detection. The phrase &ldquo;initial detection&rdquo; does not
          mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day
          (or 60-day) period begins when an appropriate review is conducted and
          a determination is made that the transaction under review is
          &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; within the meaning of the SAR requirements. A
          review must be initiated promptly upon identification of unusual

          A. Responsibility for Required AML Records and SAR Filing
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Our AML Compliance Person and his or her designee will be responsible
          for ensuring that AML records are maintained properly and that SARs
          are filed as required.&nbsp;
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          In addition, as part of our AML program, our Intuition Exchange will
          create and maintain SARs, CTRs, CMIRs, FBARs, and relevant
          documentation on customer identity and verification <em>(See</em>{" "}
          Section 5 above) and funds transmittals. We will maintain SARs and
          their accompanying documentation for at least five years. We will keep
          other documents according to existing BSA and other recordkeeping
          requirements, including certain SEC rules that require sixyear
          retention periods (<em>e.g</em>., Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(a) requiring
          Intuition Exchanges to preserve for a period of not less than six
          years, all records required to be retained by Exchange Act Rule
          17a-3(a)(1)-(3), (a)(5), and (a)(21)-(22) and Exchange Act Rule

          B. SAR Maintenance and Confidentiality
        </Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will hold SARs and any supporting documentation confidential. We
          will not inform anyone outside of FinCEN, the SEC, an SRO registered
          with the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agency
          about a SAR. We will refuse any subpoena requests for SARs or for
          information that would disclose that a SAR has been prepared or filed
          and immediately notify FinCEN of any such subpoena requests that we
          receive. <em>See </em>Section 11 for contact numbers. We will
          segregate SAR filings and copies of supporting documentation from
          other Intuition Exchange books and records to avoid disclosing SAR
          filings. Our AML Compliance Person will handle all subpoenas or other
          requests for SARs. We may share information with another financial
          institution about suspicious transactions in order to determine
          whether we will jointly file a SAR according to the provisions of
          Section 3.d. In cases in which we file a joint SAR for a transaction
          that has been handled both by us and another financial institution,
          both financial institutions will maintain a copy of the filed SAR.

          We will work closely with our clearing firm to detect money
          laundering. We will exchange information, records, data and exception
          reports as necessary to comply [with our contractual obligations and]
          with AML laws. Both Intuition Exchange and our clearing firm have
          filed (and kept updated) the necessary annual certifications for such
          information sharing, which can be found on{" "}
          <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN&rsquo;s website</a>

          obtain and use the following exception reports offered by our clearing
          Intuition Exchange in order to monitor customer activity and we will
          provide our clearing Intuition Exchange with proper customer
          identification and due diligence information as required to
          successfully monitor customer transactions. We have discussed how each
          Intuition Exchange will apportion customer and transaction functions
          and how we will share information and set forth our understanding in a
          written document. We understand that the apportionment of functions
          will not relieve either of us from our independent obligation to
          comply with AML laws, except as specifically allowed under the BSA and
          its implementing regulations.

        <Typography.Title level={3}>15. Training Programs</Typography.Title>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We will develop ongoing employee training under the leadership of the
          AML Compliance Person and senior management. Our training will occur
          on at least an annual basis. It will be based on our Intuition
          Exchange&rsquo;s size, its customer base, and its resources and be
          updated as necessary to reflect any new developments in the law.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags
          and signs of money laundering that arise during the course of the
          employees&rsquo; duties; (2) what to do once the risk is identified
          (including how, when and to whom to escalate unusual customer activity
          or other red flags for analysis and, where appropriate, the filing of
          SARs); (3) what employees&apos; roles are in the Intuition
          Exchange&apos;s compliance efforts and how to perform them; (4) Our
          record retention policy; and (5) the disciplinary consequences
          (including civil and criminal penalties) for non-compliance with the
          BSA.&nbsp;

          will maintain records to show the persons trained, the dates of
          training and the subject matter of their training.&nbsp;
