          We may collect Biometric Data during the onboarding or account
          reactivation process. Specifically, we collect, via our third-party
          service provider of identity verification services, Secure SDK,

          your facial geometry. We use and share Biometric Data only as
          described in this section.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          We use Biometric Data to identify and authenticate you, for security
          purposes. We may share Biometric Data with third-party service
          providers who assist with our IT, security, and fraud programs, our
          professional advisors, in a business transfer such as a merger or

        <ul>
          <li>
            the identity verification purposes for the collection have been

            including the description of our&nbsp;Privacy Practices&nbsp;and
            your&nbsp;Privacy Rights, apply only to California residents whose
            interactions with us are limited to:

          <li>
            consumers who initiate or complete the process of applying for

            regulations, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act
            (for additional information relating to your choices about this

            like to learn how you may opt out of our (and our third party
            advertising partners&rsquo;) use of cookies and other tracking

            <strong>Privacy Rights.&nbsp;</strong>The CCPA grants individuals
            the following rights:
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can request information about how we have collected, used
                and shared your personal information during the past 12 months.
                For details about the personal information we have collected
                over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources,
                please see the&nbsp;&lsquo;What We Collect&rsquo;&nbsp;section
                above. We collect this information for the business and
                commercial purposes described in the&nbsp;&lsquo;How We Use
                Information&rsquo; section above. We share this information with
                the categories of third parties described in the&nbsp;&lsquo;How
                We Share And Disclose Information&rsquo;&nbsp;section above.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can request a copy of the personal information that we
                maintain about you.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can ask us to delete the personal information that we
                collected or maintain about you.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example,
          prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in
          response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which
          we must comply with a deletion request.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>How To Submit A Request.&nbsp;</strong>If you would like to
            submit a request for information, access, or deletion, please
            contact&nbsp;support@intuitionexchange.org.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identity Verification.&nbsp;</strong>The CCPA requires us to
            verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access
            or delete personal information before providing a substantive
            response to the request. You may only make a verifiable request for
            access twice within a 12-month period. We will ask you to verify
            your identity when you submit a request. We cannot respond to your
            request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
            your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
            personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable request
            does not require you to create an account with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authorized Agents.&nbsp;</strong>California residents can
            empower an &ldquo;authorized agent&rdquo; to submit requests on
            their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written
            authorization confirming that authority.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Although we do not sell personal information, like most websites, we
          use cookies and other online tracking technologies on our websites.
          You may limit our use of online tracking technologies as described in
          the&nbsp;&lsquo;Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide&rsquo;&nbsp;section
          above.
